# Requirements Document

## Introduction

このプロジェクトは、Amazon Alexa Skills Kitを使用してAlexaスキルを開発し、OpenRouter APIを通じてLLM（Large Language Model）と自然な会話を可能にするアプリケーションです。ユーザーはAlexaデバイスを通じて音声でLLMと対話でき、音声による質問に対してLLMが生成した回答をAlexaが音声で返答します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Alexa user, I want to start a conversation with an LLM by saying a wake phrase, so that I can interact with AI through voice commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user says "Alexa, open AI Chat" THEN the system SHALL activate the skill and respond with a welcome message
2. WHEN the skill is activated THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to ask a question
3. IF the skill activation fails THEN the system SHALL provide an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Alexa user, I want to ask questions to the LLM through voice, so that I can get intelligent responses without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks a question after skill activation THEN the system SHALL capture the speech input accurately
2. WHEN speech input is captured THEN the system SHALL convert it to text for processing
3. IF speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL ask the user to repeat their question
4. WHEN the text is processed THEN the system SHALL send it to the OpenRouter API

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Alexa user, I want to receive spoken responses from the LLM, so that I can have a natural conversation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OpenRouter API returns a response THEN the system SHALL convert the text response to speech
2. WHEN the response is converted to speech THEN Alexa SHALL speak the response to the user
3. IF the API response is too long THEN the system SHALL truncate or summarize the response appropriately
4. WHEN the response is delivered THEN the system SHALL remain active for follow-up questions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Alexa user, I want to have multi-turn conversations with the LLM, so that I can maintain context across multiple exchanges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation is ongoing THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
2. WHEN the user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL include previous context in the API request
3. WHEN the conversation exceeds a certain length THEN the system SHALL manage context appropriately to stay within API limits
4. WHEN the user says "stop" or "exit" THEN the system SHALL end the conversation gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the skill to handle API errors gracefully, so that users have a smooth experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OpenRouter API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest trying again later
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform the user appropriately
3. WHEN invalid API responses are received THEN the system SHALL handle them without crashing
4. IF authentication with OpenRouter fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and inform the user of a temporary issue

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the LLM model and parameters, so that I can optimize the conversation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the skill is deployed THEN the system SHALL use configurable environment variables for API settings
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use appropriate model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
3. IF configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults
4. WHEN the skill starts THEN the system SHALL validate API configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an Alexa user, I want the skill to respond quickly, so that conversations feel natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is asked THEN the system SHALL respond within 8 seconds (Alexa's timeout limit)
2. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide interim feedback to the user
3. WHEN API calls are slow THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate timeout handling
4. IF response time exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL apologize and suggest trying again

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an Alexa user, I want to access premium features through a subscription, so that I can get enhanced AI conversation capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a free user exceeds daily usage limits THEN the system SHALL inform them about premium subscription options
2. WHEN a user asks about premium features THEN the system SHALL explain the benefits and guide them to purchase
3. WHEN a user purchases a subscription THEN the system SHALL unlock premium features immediately
4. IF a subscription expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully downgrade to free tier functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a free user, I want to have limited but functional access to the AI chat, so that I can try the service before subscribing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a free user starts the skill THEN the system SHALL allow up to 5 conversations per day
2. WHEN free usage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL inform the user and offer subscription options
3. WHEN a new day begins THEN the system SHALL reset free user conversation counts
4. IF a free user tries to exceed limits THEN the system SHALL politely explain the limitation

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a premium subscriber, I want unlimited conversations and advanced features, so that I get value from my subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a premium user uses the skill THEN the system SHALL provide unlimited daily conversations
2. WHEN a premium user asks questions THEN the system SHALL use higher-quality LLM models
3. WHEN a premium user has long conversations THEN the system SHALL maintain extended context history
4. IF premium features fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard features gracefully

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track subscription status and usage analytics, so that I can optimize the monetization strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the skill THEN the system SHALL log usage metrics for analytics
2. WHEN subscription events occur THEN the system SHALL track conversion and retention data
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on user engagement and revenue
4. IF analytics tracking fails THEN the system SHALL continue functioning without impacting user experience
